# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysisewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring emplyees per title and to identify the employees who are eligible for the mentorship program. Our client is concerned about the up coming "silver tusnami", a number of employees approching retirement age, signifying a massive change in personnel. We have created tables and charts with all the employee relevant emplyoee information, such as empoloyee number, first and last name, department and employement start and end date.

## Results

We have included this chart becasuse it is the most relevant to determining the job department of personnel at retirement age. The major takeaways from this data are:

- Over 90,000 employees are of retirement age.  

This is the "silver tsunami" the comapny is looking into. The Pewlett-Hackard will have to hire and train many new people to account for this loss. Perhaps they could offer part time or contract work for the senior emplyees during this time of transition. 

- The mast majority of people leaving the company are in Senior Engineering and Senior Staff roles. 

These departments will be hardest hit during this retirement cycle. 

- 1549 employees  are eligible for the mentorship program. 

These postitions are a small percentage of the total body of employees retiring. Action must be taken to fill as many roles as possible. 

- An effort to determine when the employees will retire should be undertaken. 

Just because employees are a certain age, they might not be driven to retire. Some companies offer an age plus years worked magic number in order to recieve full retirement benefits, in order to get a better sense of retirement dates. 

## Summary

As we mentioned, perhaps an analysis of tenure at the company should be looked at. Perhaps a better estimation of actual departure date could be determined, as from the table below:

Beyond that, Pewlett-Hackard will need to be aggressive about hiring. This is an issue that many companies are experiencing with the departure of the baby-boomers from the workplace. We belive that some incentive should be put into place to retain some of the workforce for training purposes, either online or into the office.
